# Rayan's Dark Forest

A lovingly illustrated, interactive forest home screen built around the exact approved design. **Phase 1: homepage only.**

## Homepage

- Displays the approved artwork as one continuous full-screen image (`assets/rayans-dark-forest.avif`), avoiding seams and dark side margins. The full original PNG remains in the downloadable archive.
- Five transparent, accessible click targets correspond to the original ornaments in the tree.
- Warm, animated fireflies and gentle focus/hover glows decorate the illustration without obscuring it.
- Each ornament opens its own dedicated placeholder page, ready for a future game or love note.
- Full-bleed desktop art, a horizontally pannable scene on portrait phones, and reduced-motion accessibility.

## Sections planned for future phases

1. Scavenger Hunt
2. Word Search Puzzle
3. Matching Memory Game
4. Secret Love Notes
5. Mystery Treasure Trail

## Deployment

No packages, build tools, external fonts, or remote image services are required. The site works as static files. For GitHub Pages, use **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)`**. Open `index.html` to preview locally.

## Word Search · Phase 2

- Six themed collections: **Dark Souls I & II**, **Lies of P**, **Bloodborne**, **Star Wars**, **Terraria / Hollow Knight / Silksong**, and **My Spoiled Little Princess**.
- Five selectable levels per collection, with **35 curated terms per level** (30 levels, 1,050 hidden words total).
- Find words in eight directions by dragging, or choose their first and last letters using touch, mouse, or keyboard.
- Progress, completed levels, and used hints are stored automatically in this browser using `localStorage`; they do not sync across devices or private-browsing sessions.
- Each level has three optional hints. Completed levels display a celebration and can be replayed.
- Enchanted AI art, warm-glow fireflies, optional original chime effects, responsive letter boards, and reduced-motion support.
- The game lives at `chapters/word-search.html` and preserves the original homepage unchanged.
