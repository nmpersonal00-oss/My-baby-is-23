# Rayan's Dark Forest

A lovingly illustrated, interactive forest home screen built around the exact approved design. **Homepage preserved; Word Search and Matching Memory chapters are playable.**

## Homepage

- Displays the approved artwork as one continuous full-screen image (`assets/rayans-dark-forest.avif`), avoiding seams and dark side margins. The full original PNG remains in the downloadable archive.
- Five transparent, accessible click targets correspond to the original ornaments in the tree.
- Warm, animated fireflies and gentle focus/hover glows decorate the illustration without obscuring it.
- Each ornament opens its own dedicated placeholder page, ready for a future game or love note.
- Full-bleed desktop art, a horizontally pannable scene on portrait phones, and reduced-motion accessibility.

## Deployment

No packages, build tools, external fonts, or remote image services are required. The site works as static files. For GitHub Pages, use **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)`**. Open `index.html` to preview locally.

## Word Search · Phase 2

- Seven illustrated collections: **Dark Souls I & II**, **Lies of P**, **Bloodborne**, **Star Wars**, **Terraria**, **Hollow Knight / Silksong**, and **My Spoiled Little Princess**.
- Five selectable levels per collection, with **35 curated terms per level** (35 levels, 1,225 hidden words total).
- Find words in eight directions by dragging, or choose their first and last letters using touch, mouse, or keyboard.
- Progress, completed levels, and used hints are stored automatically in this browser using `localStorage`; they do not sync across devices or private-browsing sessions.
- Each level has three optional hints. Completed levels display a celebration and can be replayed.
- Enchanted AI art, warm-glow fireflies, optional original chime effects, responsive letter boards, and reduced-motion support.
- The game lives at `chapters/word-search.html` and preserves the original homepage unchanged.

## Exact illustrated Word Search (new)

The Word Search page now supports the seven illustrated puzzle cards in the approved artwork, with 5 playable levels per card and 35 words per level. The transparent click targets align with the illustrated level numbers and the original local progress key is retained. The approved illustration is now published in this repository at `assets/wordsearch-worlds.webp`. The game uses it directly, with invisible interactive buttons aligned to each illustrated level badge. The original PNG is retained in the downloadable build, while the website uses a web-optimized copy. If the image cannot load, the standard playable menu remains available.

## Matching Memory · Fresh rebuild

- A brand-new matching game at `chapters/memory-game.html` replaces the earlier image-slot mockup and artwork-based hotspot layout.
- Seven themed worlds matching the Word Search collections, each with five selectable rounds: **35 rounds total**.
- Flip two cards at a time and find matching illustrated word/sigil pairs. The challenge increases from 4 to 12 pairs per round.
- Every completed round stores a personal-best move count and time in the current browser's `localStorage` (`rayans-dark-forest.memory.v2`). Replay, change levels, or return to the library at any time.
- Uses existing forest and realm artwork, glowing gold-and-pink styling, optional synthesized sound effects, keyboard-accessible buttons, and mobile-responsive cards.
- This chapter needs no additional packages or backend. The homepage and the Word Search files are unchanged.
